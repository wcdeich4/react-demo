The objective of this math folder is be minimalistic yet efficient. To be minimalistic, there is limited use of inheritance/polymorphism, for example only one matrix class.  However, to be efficient, we need methods that are specific to certain data sizes b/c methods generic to any size matrix cannot be as fast & efficient.  Hence methods like cramerSolve3D in the matrix class.
